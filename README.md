This is a simple project for the IES El Rincon where we work with BaseX to make a simple CRUD

I have added a bit of my own taste to the project, even tho the CSS is horrible now im using Materialize and some Custom CSS thats enhanced with SASS, also there is a bit of JS going on to improve the overall file structure of the project
